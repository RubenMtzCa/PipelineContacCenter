# Architect Scripting - Alpha #
This is the Architect scripting repository that has the built Architect-Scripting package which lets you create, checkin and publish Architect flows programmatically via. JavaScript.  Architect Scripting does not have parity with what you can do in Architect's UI at this time but it is extensive for flow creation.
If you really want to have just the Architect scripting framework installed, we have instructions on how to do it here but odds are this isn't what you're looking for.

## Installation ##
To install and use this repository, do the following:

* If you don't already have npm installed, then the easiest way is to install [node](http://nodejs.org/).  Note: Make sure you have Node version 4.5.0 or later installed.

* Run `npm install purecloud-flow-scripting-api-sdk-javascript` (or `sudo npm install` for Mac users) at the root of the cloned project.
This will install the dependencies for this project.

## Help Documentation ##
You can view Help documentation for Architect scripting on our [hosted documentation](https://mypurecloud.github.io/purecloud-flow-scripting-api-sdk-javascript/) or by opening the following file in your browser where ./ is the root of the cloned project:

``./src/scripting/documentation/index.html``

The help documentation, along with documenting the various scripting APIs also has standalone Node tutorials / example projects that show how to use scripting.
